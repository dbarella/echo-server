# Hello Server

This is a dumb server that responds to every request with a reversed greeting.

I wrote it in `rust` because I love `rust`.

It uses [tokio](https://tokio.rs) under the hood because I think that's a
pretty cool library.

(Full disclosure: this is just the product of following the
[tokio tutorial](https://tokio.rs/docs/getting-started/simple-server/)).
